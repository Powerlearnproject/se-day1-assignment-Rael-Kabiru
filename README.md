#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems.
Importance: Enabling digital transformation- Software engineering enables organizations to adapt to changing market demands and embrace new digital opportunities.
            Efficiency- it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
            Security- Software engineers play a vital role in developing secure software solutions that protect sensitive data and prevent cyberattacks.
            Scalability and flexibility- it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
            

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programing languages- This involved the creation of tools that allow humans to give instructions to computers, evolving from machine code to high-level languages that increase abstraction and productivity.
The establishment of software engineering as a principle in the 1960's- This period marked the recognition of software development as an engineering field, driven by the "software crisis" and the need for structured, reliable software production.
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's- Agile methodologies brought a shift towards iterative development, flexibility, and collaboration, enabling teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: It's a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.   
Requirements are defined upfront, and changes are difficult to implement later.   
It's suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments.   
Example: building a bridge, or large government projects where requirements are very well known.
Agile: It's an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration.   
Changes are welcomed, and development occurs in short cycles called sprints.   
It's suitable for projects with evolving requirements and dynamic environments.   
Example: Developing a mobile app, or any software that will require constant updates based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-  Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Developed Environment- Its importance in software development is it enhance coding efficiency, reduce errors, and accelerate development cycles.
                                  Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.
Version Control Systems-  Its importance in software development is it  enable team collaboration, manage code changes, and maintain project integrity.
                          Examples: Git and Subversion.
                          

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid technological advancement- places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current. Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
Time Constraints- Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines. Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
Limited Infrastructure- limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements- Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security- Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability- Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Integration tests- verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing- Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
 - Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to elicit the best, most accurate, or most useful response from an AI.
Importance: Improved user experience- Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
            Increased flexibility- A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
            Developer control- Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
            

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about cats
Improved prompt: Describe the common behavioral patterns of domestic cats during their first year of life, focusing on socialization and play.
Why the improved prompt is more effective: 
Clear: It specifies the subject (domestic cats), the timeframe (first year), and the specific aspects of interest (behavioral patterns, socialization, play).
Specific: It narrows down the vast topic of "cats" to a manageable and focused area.
Concise: It delivers the request efficiently, avoiding unnecessary words.
